## Intro
Freelance web designer plus front-end, back-end and all-ends-in-between web developer living in South Elgin, IL. I'm currently the Principal Programmer at Innova Apps, the company I founded in 2003.

My primary creative areas include web design, interface layout and design, and “Full Stack” web application development. I’m also actively improving my graphic/logo design skills whenever I get the chance.
